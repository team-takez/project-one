## Name

Team Takez Takeaway

## Description

Our platform gives users the ability to locate restaraunts in any specific city and allows them to find selected cuisines at miscellanious price ranges. Once the user selects a given city and cuisine, they are able to directly compare their options through descriptive tile cards. This website is free to use and has resturaunts from cities all over the globe.

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Usage

If the user is looking for resturaunts in the city of Chicago that have American cuisine and are reletively expensive, they would first type in "Chicago" in the search bar labelled "City..?" then click the magnifying glass icon. After the search is completed, which will be indicated by the appearance of resturant tiles towards the bottom of the screen, the user can then click on the "Cuisine" bar and click on the "American" option. The user will then click on the "Price Range" bar and click on the "$$-$$$" option. The resturaunt tiles at the bottom of the page will then sort themselves to resturaunts that fill those selected criteria. The user can then go through and compare resturaunts until they find their desired location.

## Support

If there is an issue regarding this web page, please contact hilltyler49@gmail.com and ak3technology@gmail.com. Please describe the issue within this email and we will reach back out when a solution is reached.

## Roadmap

Our plans for future development on the platform include adding in new features to use easier. There are plans to include a "Favorites" feature, where the user can save their favorite resturaunts for future reference. There are also plans to include a randomization option within the search features, for users who feel extra adventurous. There will also be the ability to more directly compare resturaunts, even those within difference cities. If traffic to the site grows, we will even include the ability to have unlimited pulls from the API.
