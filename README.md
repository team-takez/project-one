Team Takez Takeaway

## Description

Our platform gives users the ability to locate restaraunts in any specific city and allows them to find selected cuisines at miscellanious price ranges. Once the user selects a given city and cuisine, they are able to directly compare their options through descriptive tile cards. This website is free to use and has restaurants from cities all over the globe.

## Usage

If the user is looking for restaurants in the city of Chicago that have American cuisine and are reletively expensive, they would first type in "Chicago" in the search bar labelled "City..?" then click the magnifying glass icon. After the search is completed, which will be indicated by the appearance of resturant tiles towards the bottom of the screen, the user can then click on the "Cuisine" bar and click on the "American" option. The user will then click on the "Price Range" bar and click on the "$$-$$$" option. The resturaunt tiles at the bottom of the page will then sort themselves to restaurants that fill those selected criteria. The user can then go through and compare restaurants until they find their desired location.

## Roadmap

Our plans for future development on the platform include adding in new features to use easier. There are plans to include a "Favorites" feature, where the user can save their favorite restaurants for future reference. There are also plans to include a randomization option within the search features, for users who feel extra adventurous. There will also be the ability to more directly compare restaurants, even those within difference cities. If traffic to the site grows, we will even include the ability to have unlimited pulls from the API.
